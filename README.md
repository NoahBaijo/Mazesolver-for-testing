# QLearnMazeSolver
An interactive maze solver using Q Learning

There will be a blog post on what this is and how to use it soon. For now, you can experiment with the main program by running 

`python3 main_window.py`

This project was tested on Ubuntu Linux. The GTK tookit is required to be installed. Should work on other platforms, but has not been tested.
